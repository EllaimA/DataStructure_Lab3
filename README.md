Huffman Encoding Tree

## The purpose of this program
This program will encode string to binary code and decode binary code to string. It will first build a Huffman Encoding Tree based on a frequency table, then do the encode/decode process.

### How to run the code
run `python main.py`
The Input_Files contains default input documents(a decode input file, a encode input file and the frequency list). When run, main.py will ask for input and output directory, if not provided, the default I/O directory will be used.

The program will automatically recognize input files from the input directory and process them accordingly, generating output files in the output directory.

Notice: Currently, the output directory contains output files we generated. To see the generation process, please delete files in the output directory first, then run the program.
